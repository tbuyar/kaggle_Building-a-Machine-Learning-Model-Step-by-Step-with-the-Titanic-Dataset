RMS Titanic sank on 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean, when struck an iceberg. There were 2,224 passengers on board and this disaster resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people.
In this project, I will analyze the factors which are important for the survival ratio by using data visualization. After some feature engineering, I will build a machine learning model to predict survived passengers.
My aim in this project is to show how to handle a data set for beginners like me. Because of that reason, I shared almost every input and output.
The data set was taken from Kaggle, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster. You can find my original notebook which includes all codes in this post in this link.
